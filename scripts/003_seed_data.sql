-- Note: This seed data is for demonstration purposes
-- In production, vendors would create their own products/services

-- Insert sample vendor profiles (these would normally be created through signup)
-- We'll skip this for now since profiles are created via auth trigger

-- Sample products (you'll need to replace vendor_id with actual UUIDs after vendors sign up)
-- This is just to show the structure
